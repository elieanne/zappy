# Zappy GUI

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need a compiler that supports C++ 20.

The graphical client was made in [C++20](https://gcc.gnu.org/) using the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org)for the graphical interface. \

## Launch program

After building project, here is the help output for the 3 binaries:


```bash

DESCRIPTION:
        port is the port number
        machine is the name of the machine; localhost by default

```
### Usage

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) of Zappy serves as a visual interface that enhances the overall user experience and facilitates the management of the game. It provides a user-friendly platform for players to interact with the virtual world of Trantor and its inhabitants.
